Task-2-Unemployment-analysis-with-python
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

1.In this task, I use India's Unemployee Analysis dataset. And carried out many analyses using Python.

2.I analysed the data using pandas and numpy to draw conclusions.

3.I have done several data visualizations and animations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

4.It provides a thorough picture of the unemployment situation across states, aiding in making wise decisions.
